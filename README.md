# OpenCV Vision for an Underactuated Robot Manipulator

This repository contains all the source code related to the computer-vision part of a academic research project for controlling an underactuated robot manipulator in years 2016 and 2017. The control algorithm of the robot is not provided is this repository.

The v1, v2, and v3 versions of this project were written in Visual Studio using C# and [EmguCV](https://www.emgu.com/) and were hosted locally on my PC. Now I decided to put them in a GitHub repository in order to share it with other developers.

This is a screenshot of the UI of our vision-based control app in Windows, written in Visual Studio.

And this is the another screenshot with image processing results:

Further development of this project will add this features:

- Refactor the code and write it in Python
- Use a Python GUI framework like [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
- Write [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) image processing code in Python
