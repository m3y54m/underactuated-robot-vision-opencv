# OpenCV Vision for an Underactuated Robot Manipulator

This repository contains all the source code related to the computer-vision part of a academic research project for controlling an underactuated robot manipulator in years 2016 and 2017. The control algorithm of the robot is not provided is this repository.

## Old Versions

The v1, v2, and v3 versions of this project were written in Visual Studio using C# and [EmguCV](https://www.emgu.com/) and were hosted locally on my PC. I decided to put them in a GitHub repository in order to share it with other developers.

This is a screenshot of the GUI of old vision-based control app in Windows, written in Visual Studio.

And this is the another screenshot with image processing results:

## Current Development

Due to some limitations of C# and .NET for cross-platform application design and difficulties in using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library I refactored the code and translated it to Python and used [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for GUI design.

This is a screenshot of the GUI of new version in Linux, written in Python. (Robot joints positioning algorithm is not yet implemented.)
